# Euro2024_prediction

The 2024 UEFA European Football Championship (Euro 2024) has concluded, leaving
fans with unforgettable memories and plenty to debate about the teams, players, and strategies
that shaped the tournament. However, beyond the excitement of the matches, we were curious to
explore a different perspective: Could we have accurately predicted the winner before the
championship even began? This project sets out to answer that question by building a predictive
model using historical match data, focusing on key metrics like a custom ELO rating system and
the Expected Goals (xG) metric, alongside statistical tools such as the Poisson distribution. Our
goal is not only to forecast the winner of Euro 2024 but also to compare our prediction with the
actual outcome, critically evaluating the accuracy and reliability of our approach by answering to
the following research question How accurately can the winner of Euro 2024 be predicted
using a custom ELO rating system, Expected Goals metric, and Poisson distribution, and how
well does the model's prediction align with the actual championship outcome? By reflecting on
how well our model aligned with reality, we aim to showcase the potential of sports analytics to
anticipate outcomes in high-stakes tournaments and explore its broader implications for
stakeholders in the soccer community.
